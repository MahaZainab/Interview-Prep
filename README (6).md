# Interview Questions:
### 1. Why are you going to the USA?
Answer: 

1. I am going to the USA to do PhD in Computer Engineering at Auburn University, where I have been awarded with Graduate Assistantship which covers my tution fee and also gives monthly stipened to manage my expenses.

2. I am traveling to the USA to pursue a PhD in Computer Engineering at [University Name], where I have been awarded a Graduate Assistantship. This assistantship not only covers my tuition but also provides a monthly stipend that will support my living expenses.


### 2. How did you find this university?
Answer: 
1. As I have worked as a software Engineer and a lecturer too, I was looking for someone who has research in Software Engineering and Education as well. When I was reading different research articles, One article which really captured my attention was in Educational data mining. When I contacted that professor, she liked my profile as well and in this I applied to Auburn University.

### 3. Why did you choose this university?
Answer:
1. Bascially, my university selection was purely based upon my research interest in Dr. Farhana's research.

### 4. Please tell me little bit about your research.
Answer:  
1. My research is in Educational Data Mining in which I will make algorithms to improve source code comprehension. I will work on developing and improving tools that will help students and software engineers to understand different codes more easily. Basically, my research will decrease time that programmers spend to find bugs in there codes. 

2. QA-based source code comprehension has direct use in education to facilitate programming learning, where a system automatically answers questions about codes that someone has read.  A more general use is to help improve software maintenance since it can advance the readability of code.

Moreover, it can provide diverse information that can be leveraged to help perform a wide range of software engineering tasks, such as bug detection, specification inference, testing and code synthesis.

My research

### 5. How exactly do you implement this?
Answer: 
1. I will examine  the text using different data mining and NLP techniques and then different factors that influence the text will be examined and based upon that I will make new algorithm.
### 6. What impact do you think this will have?
Answer: 
1. This will increase productivity of students and software engineers. It will also reduce time and cost involved. We can say it will increase the efficiency of the coders and programmers either they are students or software engineers.
### 7. Example.
Answer:
1. Sure, for example, when in a semester project a student write a 1000 line of code, and there  is a bug and  student not able to find that bug, through the source code comprehension tool which i will build student will ask different questions such as what is happening inside this code or what type of parameter this function is returning. through this tool that will comprehened the code more quickly and thus he will be able to solve the  error.

### 8. What is  your major?
Answer:
1. I'll be doing Doctorate in computer engineering. 

### 9. Why you choose this major?
Answer:
1. Basically, my master's degree is in Information technology field which is closely related to computer engineering, where I did research in the field of data mining. Auburn university is offering the data mining under computer engineering major. This is the main reason to purse PhD in computer engineering.

### 10. Can you tell me more about your course?
Answer:
1. My degree has course and research work as well. First year of my degree I will take courses like Data Sturcture and algorithm and data mining. In the rest of my degree I will do research. 

### 11. What are your connections with your home country?
Answer: 
1. Basically, I am married and my husband has an established 8 years career as a biomedical engineer in Pakistan. So, I have strong sense of responsibility to come back to pakistan and take care of my family. Last year, I went to Japan on a fully funded internship and there I realized it was the best decision to go alone and do not disturb the other family members when you have the ultimate goal to come back.

### 12. Currently, what do you do?
Answer:
1. Currently, I am working as a computer science instructor in a local school. Other than that I am also working on a research and recently I have published  a research article.

### 13. Who is sponsering your education?
Answer:
1. My PhD at Auburn University will be sponsered by university itself through graduate assistantship. Which will not only cover my tution fee but also provides me monthly stipened to bear my expenses.

### 14. Are you planning to work during your program?
Answer:
1. Apart from my work as a graduate fellow, I wonâ€™t be taking any extra work as my fellowship will be ample enough to cover my living costs and tuition fees.

### 15. Why you should be given visa? or Why USA?
Answer:
When I was working as a temperory visiting faculty at NUST, I came to know that if someone wants to become a professor at a top ranked university of my country he or she must have a doctorate degree from English speaking country. And to be very honest, having research degree from USA will increase my chance to join the NUST as a professor. 

Other factor which is also important is that the research in educational data mining is conducting at Auburn specifically my professor is doing is also one of the main reason I should be given the visa so that I can enhance my expertise in data mining field.

### 16. How many universities you have applied?
Answer:
1. I have applied to one university only and I got admission along with the fully funded scholarship.
